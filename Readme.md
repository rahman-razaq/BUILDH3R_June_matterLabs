# Build smart contract

This educational experience equipped me with a thorough foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. By completing practical tasks and sharing progress on GitHub, I acquired hands-on knowledge and built a representative portfolio. I mastered creating ERC20 tokens, managing blockchain-stored hashed messages, and automating interactions with smart contracts using ethers.js. Additionally, I delved into zkSync and paymasters for handling transaction fees and managing token balances.
